LearningProjects
================

Projects and their solutions in whatever language we happen to be learning at the time.

The goal of this project is to provide a set of learning excercises that progress from utter beginner to decently proficient in that language.

Directory Structure
-------------------

At the top level, we differentiate different language "types" in which we're working. This allows us to take different approaches to different languages.  For instance, doing console IO in Processing is not likely helpful, and sometimes you're only looking to learn how to manipulate an embedded MCU.  This facilitates that, and allows languages to cross into multiple types to make the learning match the desired goal, despite a language like C being able to be in almost all "types" of curriculums.

Underneath that, there is a series of projects.  They all start with either Project### where ### is a number from 001 on, or Project-EX### which are extra and not required for the progression originally intended.

Inside will be a programmer's directory bearing their name which will itself contain directories of each language they've done the project in.

How to participate
------------------

The most obvious way you can join in is to fork this repo and try the projects yourself.

If you'd like to add to projects, we can accept pull requests for projects, but would prefer just a message about the project you'd like to add and to what track.  Apologies ahead of time for requests to add examples, but the default examples will be from various members of the Tod 'n' Lorna community.  If you'd like to chat with them, we have an IRC channel on irc.esper.net at #todandlorna or you can check out the website, experimental as it might be, at http://www.todandlorna.com/
