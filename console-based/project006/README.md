"FizzBuzz"

This is a classic puzzle.  Take a positive integer as input.  Count from 0 to that number.  On every multiple of 3 (so 3, 6, 9, etc) output "Fizz" instead of the number.  On every multiple of 5 (so 5, 10, 15, etc) output "Buzz" instead of the number.  For any multiple of both 3 and 5, output "FizzBuzz" instead of the number. At the end, wait for any input key press.

An example snippet of output would be:
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz
Fizz
22

Thoughts
--------

Does your language of a modulo operator?
Can you make your program any more efficient?  How would you know if it was more efficient?
