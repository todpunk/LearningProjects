"Fibonacci without Recursion"

A Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and then every sequential number is the result of adding the previous number.  So the sequence goes for the first 8 numbers:

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13

Take as input a single integer (n) less than 100.  Make a separate function or subroutine that will be called with (n) as input.  This function should NOT call itself recursively and the result should output the Fibonnaci sequence up to the (nth) number.

So for input of 8, it will output the sequence above.

Thoughts
--------

Does it take longer to do a higher number?
What happens if you increase the limit from 100 to 1000?
