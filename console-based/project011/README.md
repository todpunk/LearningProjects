"Sorting numbers"

There are a number of sorting algorithms out there.  We will not limit you on selecting which you wish to implement here, but learning how they work is an exercise to you.  This is itself a practice common in programming, and should help you learn how to start from very little direction.

Find three sorting algorithms for a set of numbers.  You should generate a list of numbers randomly each run, and these numbers should be from -9999 to 9999.  Generate 1000 of these numbers, unless you are constrained in memory (like in embedded programming).  Sort this list afterward, and output the kind of sort and how long it took.  On the first two algorithms, leave the original number set intact (either copy it or sort it into a new memory set).  On the last algorithm, organize it without using more than a single number worth of extra memory.

Thoughts
--------

What is your fastest algorithm?  Slowest?  Why?
What changes if you want to sort strings?
What else can you apply these sorting algorithms to?
