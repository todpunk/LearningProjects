"Hello World"

Output "Hello World" to the screen.

Thoughts
--------

As the easiest program in any language that can do console output, this really is an exercise in your workflow and tools, not a stretch of the language.  If your language doesn't come with the tools to do console output and input, this would be a significant exercise in a lot of computing areas.  Hopefully you aren't looking for the Embedded track instead.
