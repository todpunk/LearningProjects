"Add me"

Take two numbers separately.  Each number should be validated as a number, and if they are not a number, it should be requested again.  Once two numbers are finally supplied, the two of them should be added, and the result returned.  Note that this should work with floating points as well.


Thoughts
--------

Are you repeating the whole question asking or are you just asking the question they input wrong?
What other things could you do to these two numbers?
