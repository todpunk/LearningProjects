"Tower of Hanoi"

Look up the Tower of Hanoi.  Build a program that takes a number between 3 and 9 (at least) and outputs every step to the solution of a Tower of Hanoi with that many disks, moving from far left to far right poles.

Thoughts
--------

How many steps does each additional disk add?
How are you keeping track of the state of your virtual puzzle?
If you were given a random configuration in the middle of the process, could you determine what needed to be done next?
