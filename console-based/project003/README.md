"Round me"

Take a single integer.  Round it to the nearest 10s value and output the result.  For example, if it is 3, the result should be 0. If it is 35, the result should be 40.  If it is 23513463 the result is 23513460.


Thoughts

What pieces of the number do you need to look at to determine the rounding direction?
