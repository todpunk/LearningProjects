"Basic Calculator, Advanced String Tokenizing"

Take a string in the form of "2 + 2" (spaces required) which will return the result of the equation.  This string should be arbitrarily long.  Thus, "8 - 4 + 7 * 3" should be valid input.  Ignore "=" signs if they are at the end.

If the string can not be parsed, return the piece that was troublesome.  Exit on a "Q" at the beginning of a string.

Thoughts
--------

How would this be different if spaces were NOT required?
Are you doing the order of operations correctly?
Can you add parenthesis to this easily?
