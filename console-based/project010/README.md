"Linked Lists"

A linked list is a piece of data that is a reference to an initial "node," with each "node" containing a value of some sort and some sort of reference to the "next" item in the list, with the final item pointing to some indicator that it has no item.

Tell the user you will take numbers until they enter a "Q" for quit.  You can decide if lower case 'q' will also work.  Put each number into order in the list.  So if you have a list with 4 -> 8 -> 35 -> 7131 and the user puts in 12, the list will then be 4 -> 8 -> 12 -> 35 -> 7131.  When the user ends, output the entire contents of the list.

Thoughts
--------

How many things do you have to do to the list to put something in the middle?  How fast can you find out where the new number should go?  How would this be easier?
Can you make a list that points both to the "node" next in the list and the "node" previous?  How much more code is this?  What ability does this give you?
