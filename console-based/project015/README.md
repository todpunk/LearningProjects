"Rollin Ball Clock Simulator"

Look up a rolling ball clock.  It should involve a number of ball "holders" that fill at a regular basis, with the seconds holder feeding the others.  Make a simulation of the state of this clock, with each ball being identified individually.  Make the initial state of the ball clock and find out how many "seconds" it will take a rolling ball clock to return to the original state of the order of balls.

Thoughts
--------

How often do you need to make the check of the state of the balls?
What do you learn about the state of the clock after every hour?  Every day?  Half-day?  Week?
Look at the efficiency of your clock.  How fast does it run, how long does it take to determine the solution, knowing nothing from before the program is run?  Can it be faster?
