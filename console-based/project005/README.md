"Count down for me"

Take a single integer from input, and then ouput that number and every number all the way through 0.  If it is a negative number, count up through 0.  Each number should be separated by some sort of white space.


Thoughts
--------

Try counting from a really large number.  Then modify your program so it doesn't do the output of anything but the 0.  See if it is faster or not.
