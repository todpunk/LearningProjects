"Functions"

Take as input a single integer (n).  Make a separate function or subroutine that will be called with (n) as input.  This function should double the number, and return that result.  Output the result of this function on n, n+1, n+5 and n+n.

So for input of 8, it will output:
16
18
26
32

Thoughts
--------

How does this function reduce the amount of typing we have to do?
Are there any costs to this function mechanic?
