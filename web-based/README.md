Console Based track
================

Projects in this directory are involve some sort of software rendering in a square window.  This can mean anything from an implementation in a language like Processing, or something in a framework like Love2D for Lua.  The drawing will be done through a web server of some sort.  They should output HTML or some sort of web protocol like SOAP or FTP.  An example of a language good for this might be PHP or ASP.NET (in its many forms).  It will also involve HTML, Javascript, and CSS as part of the problem domain.  Other web technologies such as WebGL are encouraged when prolific enough.
