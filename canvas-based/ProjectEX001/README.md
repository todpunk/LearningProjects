"Conway's Game of Life"

Implement Conway's Game of Life on a grid of no less and 20x20 squares, but with an upper limit of just reasonably being able to see the squares.  A mouse down or touch should toggle the square under that point, thus enabling someone to "switch" a single square or simply drag across the field to toggle a bunch.  There should also be some sort of pause mechanism for resuming or halting the simulation of the GoL.

Thoughts
--------

What limitations for input do you have in the two actions?  Could you swap the input mechanisms perhaps?
What other rule sets can you implement?  Perhaps modifying the current number of "neighbours" or distance of "neighbours" viewed?  What about something more abstract?
Can you make a war of colors?  How do the colors interact?  How about a political system of working well with those nearby on the color wheel but hating those opposite?  Visa versa?
