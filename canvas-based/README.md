Canvas Based track
================

Projects in this directory are involve some sort of software rendering in a rectangular window.  This can mean anything from an implementation in a language like Processing, or something in a framework like Love2D for Lua.  The drawing will not be done with something like OpenGL or DirectX.  An abstraction like SDL may be appropriate, but again it should not be 3D graphics, just basic drawing stuff.  Input/Output will be mouse/single-touch and possibly key-presses for input, display of some sort of graphical artifacts as output.
