"Turtle Graphics"

Implement a blank canvas, with a virtual "turtle" in the center of the screen.  This turtle has a visual representation and a "marker" tied to its tail.  Take some sort of input from the user as directions for the turtle, or changing of its "marker" color.  As it moves, it draws on the canvas.  The turtle can move forward/back, or turn left/right.  See if you can make a usable interface to take repeatable steps such that a user could draw fractions using functions of some kind.

Thoughts
--------

How does your implementation compare with Logo?
What other "tools" could you attach for the turtle to "use" somehow?
What limitations does this give the user compared to other drawing applications?  What strengths does it offer?
How would you move from a single "turtle" to more?  Are they controlled together or separately?  Do they interact at all?
